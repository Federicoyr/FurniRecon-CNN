Abstract:

Nowadays, technology is giving rise to new services and platforms for products.
Digital transformation since COVID-19 has shifted from being optional to being
essential. Current instances of companies that resisted transforming their busi-
ness models, due to inability or stubbornness, have faced extinction, reminiscent
of the fate of Blockbuster. According to numerous studies, A.I. is predicted to
trigger one of historyâ€™s most profound revolutions, with a multitude of companies
set to implement it in the coming years. Consequently, businesses not prepared
for this new digitally personalized world risk being consumed by the competi-
tive landscape and evolving market. Among these markets, interior design stands
out, and notably, significant suppliers can play a crucial role, but only if they
undergo a digital transformation by offering their products, for instance, through
augmented reality or the metaverse. This trend towards personalization and the
creation of immersive realities will gain even more relevance in the upcoming
years, presenting a perfect opportunity to ride this wave. Thus, we present the
problem, analyze the tools, variables, and methods required to create a saleable
service for these companies. This service empowers them to transform their busi-
ness models through a more digital sales approach while we are exploring different
viewpoints on methods and tools for creating this service
